					<p class="subtitle">Ninjustu</p>

						<p>Ninjutsu (忍術, English TV: Ninja Art, literally meaning: Ninja Techniques) is one of the three main jutsu categories. Ninjutsu is the most nebulous of the three, and may most simply be described as anything that is not genjutsu or taijutsu. Most ninjutsu require chakra and hand seals, but this is not always the case since the mere usage of weaponry qualifies as ninjutsu. The huge range of ninjutsu's uses is illustrated by its several sub-classifications: medical ninjutsu, reincarnation ninjutsu, space–time ninjutsu, barrier ninjutsu, sealing jutsu, cursed seal jutsu and sensory ninjutsu.</p>
					</div>
					<p class="subtitle">Genjustu</p>
					<div>
						<img src="picture/genjutsu.gif" />
						<p>Genjutsu (幻術, literally meaning: Illusionary Techniques) is one of the main jutsu categories which uses chakra. Unlike ninjutsu, the effects of genjutsu are not real, being only sensory illusions experienced by those who fall victim to it. </p>
					</div>
					<p class="subtitle">Taijustu</p>
					<div>
						<img src="picture/taijutsu.gif" />
						<p>Taijutsu (体術, literally meaning: Body Techniques) is a basic form of techniques and refers to any techniques involving the martial arts or the optimisation of natural human abilities. Taijutsu is executed by directly accessing the user's physical and mental energies, relying on the stamina and strength gained through training. It typically does not require chakra, though chakra may be used to enhance its techniques. Taijutsu generally requires no hand seals to perform, occasionally making use of certain stances or poses, and are far quicker to use than ninjutsu or genjutsu. Taijutsu is, simply put, hand-to-hand combat. </p>

					<summary>Sub Justu</summary>
					<p class="subtitle">Medical Ninjustu</p>
					<div>
						<img src="picture/medical-jutsu.gif" />
						<p>Medical ninjutsu (医療忍術, Iryō Ninjutsu, literally meaning: Medical Ninja Techniques) is a branch of ninjutsu associated with healing, as well as the manipulation of their own, or another's body, practised by shinobi categorised as "medical-nin". The use of medical ninjutsu requires very advanced chakra control, as well as extensive knowledge on such things as herbs, medicines, the human body and even poisons.</p>
					</div>
					<p class="subtitle">Clone Techniques</p>
					<div>
						<img src="picture/Clone Techniques.gif" />
						<p>Clone techniques (分身術, Bunshinjutsu) are techniques that create copies of the user or their tools. Though the standard Clone Technique is considered the most basic of ninjutsu, these techniques are highly versatile, often used to distract enemies or fool them into thinking they have landed a hit on the user. Corporeal clones can aid the user in physical combat, and even use techniques independent of the original. </p>
					</div>
					<p class="subtitle">Senjustu</p>
					<div>
						<img src="picture/Senjustu.gif" />
						<p>Senjustu (仙術, "Sage Jutsu","Sage Techniques") is a special ability only for those who are practitioners to learn how to draw the energy of nature inside of there bodies blending it with their own chakra and with combining the Spiritual Energy ( or Mental energy) and there Physical energies. Which gains the user the field of jutsu that allows the user to sense and gather the natural energy (自然 エネルギー, Shizen Enerugī) surrounding the field to use to your advantage. Senjutsu specialists can make this energy penetrate and combine them with their own creating a new and powerful chakra called "Senjutsu Chakra" (仙術 チャクラ, Senjutsu Chakura). This chakra type allows the user to enter a new state called the "Sage Mode", which can dramatically increase the strength of all ninjutsu, genjutsu and taijutsu and can increase the physical body and speed times two. A person who is able to use Senjutsu is called a Sage (仙人, Sennin). Senjutsu chakra cannot be used by those untrained in senjutsu, meaning a shinobi who doesn’t know the proper stages of senjustu can’t learn Sage Mode and its complete enhances. </p>
					</div>
					<p class="subtitle">Shuriken justu</p>
					<div>
						<img src="picture/Shurikenjustu.gif" />
						<p>Shurikenjutsu (手裏剣術, literally meaning: concealed hand blade techniques) pertains to techniques that entail the throwing of shuriken, kunai, senbon, or any other number of bladed, hand-held weapons. Shurikenjutsu can be used in combination with taijutsu, ninjutsu, and/or chakra flow in order to create more devastating techniques. Additionally, shurikenjutsu can pertain to techniques used through ninjutsu-made weapons.</p>

					<summary>Blood Limit</summary>
					<p class="subtitle">Kekkei Genkai</p>
					<div>
						<img src="picture/Kekkei Genkai.gif" />
						<p>A kekkei genkai (血継限界, literally meaning: Bloodline Limit) is an anomaly of the DNA that allows the wielder to use unique techniques. A kekkei genkai's name describes both the anomaly and the resulting technique. Most kekkei genkai are passed down between generations of a clan, an exception being Hashirama Senju's Wood Release. Likewise, most individuals only inherit one kekkei genkai, but Mei Terumī is known to naturally possess two.</p>
					</div>
					<p class="subtitle">Dojustu</p>
					<div>
						<img src="picture/Dojustu.gif" />
						<p>Dōjutsu (瞳術, English TV: Visual Jutsu, literally meaning: Eye Techniques) are ninja abilities that utilise the eyes, a by-product of specific kekkei genkai or kekkei mōra. The word refers to both the eyes themselves, which have a number of passive abilities, and any jutsu dependent on the eyes to be performed; the former requires little to no chakra to be used, while the latter varies depending on the technique. Dōjutsu can be transplanted into others, though use of the dōjutsu is typically more limited or taxing for those without a genetic predisposition for it.[1] While the user's eyes can be overused and dōjutsu can be prevented from being accessed for a period of time, it doesn't mean the user will be exhausted and they can still use other techniques. Of all the known dōjutsu, the Byakugan, Rinnegan, and Sharingan are collectively known as the Three Great Dōjutsu (三大瞳術, San Daidōjutsu, English TV: Three Great Visual Jutsu, literally meaning: Three Great Eye Techniques).[2]</p>
